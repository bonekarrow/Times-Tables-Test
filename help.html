<title>Times Tables Quiz - Help and About</title>

<h1>Help and About</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Newlaithes Primary School uses a variety of tests in different years (Y3, Y4, Y5) to evaluate how well the kids
    are learning their times tables. We found our daughter was strong on her times tables but had poor <em>exam
    technique</em> when it came to doing the tests. This times tables quiz is a way of practising the test at home 
    as well as learning times tables.
</p>

<h2>How To Use</h2>
<p>
    The first time you use the quiz (or if you haven't used it for a while) you will need to follow the indicated 
    hyperlink to configure the quiz. This means:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Choosing the number(s) to include in the quiz.</li>
    <li>How many questions to include in the quiz.</li>
    <li>What sort of questions to include.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The quiz can include several types of questions. By default it will ask plain questions e.g 6 &times; 7 = ?, 
    27 &divide; 9 = ?. It will also do:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>squares and square roots;</li>
    <li>decimal fractions e.g. 6 &times; 0.7 = ?, 27 &divide; 0.9 = ?;</li>
    <li>vulgar fractions e.g. 6/7 of 56 = ?;</li>
    <li>harder vulgar fractions - these are either vulgar fractions applied to decimal fractions or vulgar fractions
        applied to larger numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can choose to answer just one type of question or combinations of different types. If you purposefully choose
    not to include any type of questions then, quite reasonably, the quiz won't work. Note that you can only choose the 
    harder vulgar fraction questions if you've already chosen the ordinary vulgar fraction questions.
</p>
<p>
    There's nothing to stop you choosing to include thousands of questions in the quiz. It should work but may take a 
    while to generate. Making your child answer thousands of times tables questions probably contravenes the United
    Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</p>

<h2>Using the Quiz Online</h2>
<p>
    The answers can be filled out online. Use <code>TAB</code> or <code>ENTER</code> to move to the next question. The 
    &ldquo;Mark&rdquo; button will only be enabled when all the questions are answered. Unsurprisingly, this button shows 
    which questions are answered correctly. You then have the opportunity to try and answer any you got wrong again.
</p>

<h2>Generating a New Quiz</h2>
<p>
    There is an explicit button to generate a new quiz. All this does is <em>reload</em> the page. You can achieve the 
    same effect by pressing <code>F5</code> in nearly all web browsers.
</p>
<p>
    The quiz is randomly generated and there is some attempt to avoid repeating the same question. However if you ask for 
    a lot of questions on a limited set of numbers and question types then there will be repetitions. 
</p>

<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>
    I often print quizzes out for my daughter. When printing the quiz, lots of the irrelevant parts of the web page are 
    automatically discarded to avoid wasting paper. You can get at least 45 questions on one sheet of A4. To print 
    multiple copies of different quizzes I repeat the key sequence <code>F5</code> (new quiz), <code>CTRL-P</code> (a 
    shortcut keystroke for printing in most web browsers) and <code>ENTER</code> (to confirm printing in most web browsers).
    I can't guarantee this will work for you but worth a try.
</p>

<h2>Mobile Phones and Pads</h2>
<p>
    On desktops and laptops the quiz should display acceptably using four columns. However on mobile devices (e.g. tablets
    and phones) this might not be the case. You can restrict the number of columns used in the configuration of the quiz if 
    you wish. Ideally this would happen automatically, but that's life for you.
</p>
